"You’re building a fantasy RPG game. Each time a player creates a new character (Knight, Mage, Archer),
 the system has to load multiple deep attributes (weapons, AI settings, stats). Now players want to copy
  an existing character to create a new one with a few changes."

You must create multiple characters based on existing ones.
